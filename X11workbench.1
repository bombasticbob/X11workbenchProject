.SH NAME
Xbench \- A simple programmer\'s work bench application for X11

.SH SYNOPSIS
Xbench is a simple launching and editing platform for creating
applications under the X11 environment.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Xbench does what no other editor in X11 seems to get right.  It
lets you move the line cursor up and down without horizontally
bouncing around like a frog on a hot plate.  It also provides a
simple \(yet powerful\) environment from which you can develop
your applications.  The intent is to make this an X11
open source replacement for commercial development software.

Additionally this package ONLY uses X11 and Motif as run
dependencies.  This is by design.  Additional dependencies
may be the result of add-on features by third parties, but
the intent is to make the core application as simple as possible.

.SH USAGE
Xbench filename

Actions depend upon the type of file that \'filename\' represents.
