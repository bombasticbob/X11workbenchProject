.SH NAME
X11workbench \- A simple programmer\'s IDE application for X11

.SH SYNOPSIS

X11workbench is a simple launching and editing platform for
creating applications under the X11 environment.

.SH DESCRIPTION

X11workbench does what no other editor in X11 seems to get right.
It lets you move the line cursor up and down without horizontally
bouncing around like a frog on a hot plate, automatically trims
all of the extraneous white space from the ends of lines, and
enforces hard and soft tab indents.  It also provides a simple
(yet powerful) environment from which you can develop and debug
your applications.  The intent is to make this an X11 open source
replacement for commercial development 'IDE' software.

Additionally, this package ONLY uses X11 and the C runtime library
as dependencies.  This is by design.  Additional dependencies
can result from the use of specific configuration features, or by
modification from third parties, but the intent is to make the
core application as simple as possible, and for all X11 platforms.

.SH USAGE

X11workbench [options] [filename]
  where      filename is one or more optional file names
   and       \'options\' is one or more 'switches' preceded by \'-\'

Actions taken depend upon the type(s) of file(s) that \'filename\'
represents.

The 'Options' that are supported are:

  \-h          display a help message describing these options
  \-d          dump settings on startup
  \-\-nosplash  Skip the 'splash' screen on startup

X11workbench Toolkit options (these should precede other options)
  \-\-debug n       debug level (default 0, errors only)
                  1 = minimal, 7 is maximum debug level
  \-\-subsys xx     subsystem to debug (implies --debug 7 if not
                  specified)
                  'xx' is a subsystem name or bit value
                  (see window_helper.h for more information)
                  A bit value of 1 is equivalent to the lowest
                  subsystem bit
                  NOTE:  this option can be specified multiple times
  \-\-display xx    X11 display to use (default is DISPLAY env variable)
  \-\-minimize      show minimized window on startup
  \-\-maximize      show maximized window on startup
  \-\-geometry geom specify window geometry on startup
                  geometry spec as per X specification
                  (see X man page)
                  typical value might be 800x600+100+50
                  (default centers window with reasonable size)
