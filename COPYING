RESTRICTIONS ON COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION

The X11workbench and Toolkit software may be freely distributed  under
the terms of the license restrictions covered by this document.

LICENSE
=======

The X11workbench application itself is covered by a dual license.  You
may choose one or the other, but not both (since they are usually not
compatible with one another anyway).

The two license choices are:
  a) STANDARD GPL or LGPL LICENSE
  b) BSD-style LICENSE

Additionally, other copyrights may also apply, for code that may be
considered to have been 'derived'.  These are currently displayed within
the source code at the appropriate places, for reference.

THIS SOFTWARE IS BEING PROVIDED AS-IS, WITH NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.  USE IT AT
YOUR OWN RISK.  S.F.T. INC. CLAIMS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ACTIONS OR CONSE-
QUENCES THAT MAY ARISE FROM THE USE, ABUSE, OR DISTRIBUTION OF THIS SOFTWARE.

For the actual license text, see LICENSE.


                   ADDITIONAL LICENSES THAT MIGHT APPLY
                   ====================================

There are some additional licenses that might apply, due to a portion of the
code potentially being 'derived code' from the original.  In particular, some
of the 'Xorg API equivalence' code for XImage might be considered 'derived'.
As such, to respect the original license, the copyright information has been
included as comments within the source, to idenfity that part of the code
which might be covered by such a copyright.  Derived code may also need to
include those copyrights.  For more information, see 'COPYING'.
