# X11workbenchProject

The X11 Work Bench, an IDE for working on X11 applications, with a simple C
language toolkit that should be familiar and easy to use for old school GUI
programmers

This application is in a pre-alpha state, which basically means that it's
non-functional, but has a lot of interesting features.  For example, the
toolkit's basic functionality (minus some details) is working.  The sample
'Hello World' application should compile and run.  And the library itself
will build properly.

However, it does not (yet) function as in the project description.  Not yet,
anyway.

This project was originally being hosted at

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/X11workbench
  
It is likely to remain there, but only as binary ZIP downloads.  The actual
source tree, issues, wiki, and online documentation will be here on github.
