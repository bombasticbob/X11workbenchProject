       X11workbench - A simple programmer's IDE application for X11


SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       X11workbench  is  a  simple launching and editing platform for creating
       applications under the X11 environment.


DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       X11workbench does what no other editor in X11 seems to get  right.   It
       lets you move the line cursor up and down without horizontally bouncing
       around like a frog on a hot  plate,  automatically  trims  all  of  the
       extraneous  white  space  from the ends of lines, and enforces hard and
       soft tab indents.  It also provides a simple (yet powerful) environment
       from  which you can develop and debug your applications.  The intent is
       to make this an X11 open source replacement for commercial  development
       'IDE' software.

       Additionally,  this  package ONLY uses X11 and the C runtime library as
       dependencies.  This is by design.  Additional dependencies  can  result
       from  the  use  of  specific configuration features, or by modification
       from third parties, but the intent is to make the core  application  as
       simple as possible, and for all X11 platforms.


UUSSAAGGEE
       X11workbench [options] [filename]
         where      filename is one or more optional file names
          and       'options' is one or more 'switches' preceded by '-'

       Actions taken depend upon the type(s) of file(s) that 'filename' repre-
       sents.

       The 'Options' that are supported are:

         -h          display a help message describing these options
         -d          dump settings on startup
         --nosplash  Skip the 'splash' screen on startup

       X11workbench Toolkit options (these should precede other options)
         --debug n       debug level (default 0, errors only)
                         1 = minimal, 7 is maximum debug level
         --subsys xx     subsystem to debug (implies --debug 7 if not
                         specified)
                         'xx' is a subsystem name or bit value
                         (see window_helper.h for more information)
                         A bit value of 1 is equivalent to the lowest
                         subsystem bit
                         NOTE:  this option can be specified multiple times
         --display xx    X11 display to use (default is DISPLAY env variable)
         --minimize      show minimized window on startup
         --maximize      show maximized window on startup
         --geometry geom specify window geometry on startup
                         geometry spec as per X specification
                         (see X man page)
                         typical value might be 800x600+100+50
                         (default centers window with reasonable size)
