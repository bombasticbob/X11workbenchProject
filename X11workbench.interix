    Xbench - A simple programmer's work bench application for X11

  SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
    Xbench is a simple launching and editing platform for creating
    applications under the X11 environment.

    Xbench does what no other editor in X11 seems to get right.  It
    lets you move the line cursor up and down without horizontally
    bouncing around like a frog on a hot plate.  It also provides a
    simple (yet powerful) environment from which you can develop
    your applications.  The intent is to make this an X11
    open source replacement for commercial development software.

    Additionally this package ONLY uses X11 and Motif as run
    dependencies.  This is by design.  Additional dependencies
    may be the result of add-on features by third parties, but the
    intent is to make the core application as simple as possible.
